:tomato: tomato - math::geometry 3D library
================
`tomato math::geometry` is an geometry 3D library with basics functions for working in 3D space...
This [Tcl](https://www.tcl.tk) package is inspired , copied (as best I could) from this great library written in .Net [Math.NET Spatial](https://spatial.mathdotnet.com/#Math-NET-Spatial). Some features for this class `Quaternion` are inspired by this python library [pyquaternion](http://kieranwynn.github.io/pyquaternion/).

#### Currently geometries supported are :
| Class | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| Vector | A Class representing a Vector in 3D space |
| Ray | A Class representing a Ray in 3D space |
| Point | A Class representing a Point in 3D space  |
| Plane | A Class representing a Plane in 3D space |
| Matrix3d | Helper class for working with 3D matrixes |
| Basic Matrix | Defines the base class for Matrix classes (basic matrixes for `CoordinateSystem`, `Matrix3d` and `Vector`)|
| Line | A Class representing a Line in 3D space|
| Coordinate System | A Class representing a Coordinate System |
| Quaternion | A Class representing a Quaternion |
